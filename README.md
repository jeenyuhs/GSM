# Glob's Skyblock Mod (GSM)
A Hypixel Skyblock mod, that includes features that the other mods I use, lack!

# Disclaimer
Lost interest playing Hypixel Skyblock, so this is getting published in it's current and broken state.
I might regain the interest and continue development.

## Features
* starred dungeon mob highlighter
* automatically close dungeon rewards
* wrong book combination prevention and alert
* rare drops announcer and auto copy
* livid solver
* instant dungeon requeue
* balloon barrage timer (most useful in m1)
* remove block breaking particle

Bannable mods (i think):
* Crystal Hollows treasure ESP (used for powder grinding and limited to 10(?) blocks radius)
* Fairy Grotto finder (definitely bannable)
